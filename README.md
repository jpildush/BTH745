## Week 6
A. Complete Wireframe with details (actually this time)! - Use either Google, Microsoft or Apple assets (Or something else that looks nice!)
  Wireframes must be complex - this means every button that goes somewhere or looks interactable must do so! Even if the destination is   just another dummy page.
  
B. Come up with 3 tasks and do them yourself. Record the number of screens required as well as the time it takes to do that task within your application. As a bonus - create 2 short survey questions that is tailored specifically for your application


C. Nov 2 is the next class where we will be testing. You are required to be here to help test your app!

D. Set up a meeting before this date ! PLEASE Post your availability after the reading week.

#### Monday 
Adam - After test - before 1:30pm  
#### Tuesday

#### Wednesday
Adam - before 1:30pm
